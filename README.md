Overall, the problem-solving process was straightforward and effective. The goal was clear: predict BMI based on height, weight, and gender using a supervised learning approach. I started by loading and cleaning the data, selecting the right features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to make sure the model could generalize well.
I chose Linear Regression because it's a simple but reliable model for predicting continuous outcomes like BMI. After training the model, I evaluated it using MSE, which turned out to be 0.4902. A strong result showing the model was making accurate predictions.
Plotting the actual vs. predicted BMI values helped visually confirm the modelâ€™s performance, with most points lining up nicely along the ideal trend. There were a few outliers, but nothing that seriously impacted the results.
